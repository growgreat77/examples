# Modbus Tcp

trioop.hmi@gmail.com

For local use only, no external distribution allowed

Up to 8 ModbusTCP clients can be created, supporting ABCD CDAB BADC DCBA big and small endian selections

# 注意

1. 使能按钮用于连接和断开PLC的连接。删除数据源之前，需要将使能按钮断开。

2. 第一次按了“Save & test”按钮，“Variable Name”就属于某个“Data Type”，在同一个“Database”，就无法修改成其他的数据类型了。

3. 如果想修改变量名的数据类型，需要一并修改Database的名字，或者重新初始化Database数据库。

4. 最多可以添加8个数据源，数据源根据Client ID进行区别。

<!-- To help maximize the impact of your README and improve usability for users, we propose the following loose structure:

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN**
- Ensure all links are absolute URLs so that they will work when the README is displayed within Grafana and Grafana.com
- Be inspired ✨
  - [grafana-polystat-panel](https://github.com/grafana/grafana-polystat-panel)
  - [volkovlabs-variable-panel](https://github.com/volkovlabs/volkovlabs-variable-panel)

**ADD SOME BADGES**

Badges convey useful information at a glance for users whether in the Catalog or viewing the source code. You can use the generator on [Shields.io](https://shields.io/badges/dynamic-json-badge) together with the Grafana.com API
to create dynamic badges that update automatically when you publish a new version to the marketplace.

- For the logo field use 'grafana'.
- Examples (label: query)
  - Downloads: $.downloads
  - Catalog Version: $.version
  - Grafana Dependency: $.grafanaDependency
  - Signature Type: $.versionSignatureType

Full example: ![Dynamic JSON Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?logo=grafana&query=$.version&url=https://grafana.com/api/plugins/grafana-polystat-panel&label=Marketplace&prefix=v&color=F47A20)

Consider other [badges](https://shields.io/badges) as you feel appropriate for your project.
